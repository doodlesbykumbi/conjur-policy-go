# Marshalling
This example demonstrates how to read policy from yaml file and then use `unmarshal` to decode bytes into `PolicyStatements` object.

To run this example:<br>
```shell
go run .
```

See [documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/yaml.v3@v3.0.1#Unmarshal) for more details on yaml unmarshalling.
