# Contributing to Conjur

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Testing

Ensure the unit tests are green.

```shell
go test -v -count=1 ./...
```

## Code generation

Go generate is used in this project. For example, enums for the Kind type are autogenerated.

Ensure changes to the source files for code generation are accompanied by the code generation itself:

```shell
go generate ./...
```

## Pre-commit

This project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure changes are properly formatted and validated by linters. <br>
It also contains gitleaks to ensure no credentials are present in code.

### Installation

For MacOS users
```shell
brew install pre-commit
```

Install using pip
```shell
python -m pip install pre-commit
```

### Usage

To manually run pre-commit hooks on all files:
```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

To install pre-commit hooks (it will then automatically run on each commit)
```shell
pre-commit install
```
